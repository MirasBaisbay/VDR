Meeting notes for 05/02:

We need structure from rcsb of humans, zebrafish, vampire fish (sea lamprey), and rats.

Alpha helices, we measure angles (center of mass, from helices to another)
Geometric approach , then clustering
homodimer two diff colors, synthetic rainbow
Procedure: Conservation of all the structures (uniprot, sequence, add to basic, entry choose all, tools, align and click completed) blue conserved, light blue similar, white is hinge region -> remove dna-binding and hinge, download the sequence and then paste it here -> https://www.ebi.ac.uk/jdispatcher/msa Clustal omega - more useful. 


We need to do a grouping based on resolution (before than lower than 1, between 1-2 or 2.5 and then over 2) to analyze how phi/psi angles change, low quality data (no resolution)


Download all files -> choose align and then paste the code pymol (prof will send it) “mas align” for visualization is useful for alignment, but not necessary. 
Command which all loads the structures (search for it)
Command “sup…” (superimpose) to download the all files and then extract the torsion angles  etc, using this data for clustering.

Protein sequence:  observation from all organisms(fish should be with bones)

#Code for pdb, percentage, code for phi/psi, omega angles, look through the code of pymol about phi/psi.
